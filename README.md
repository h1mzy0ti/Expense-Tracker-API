## Getting Started

You can run this project locally in two ways:

---

### Option 1: Complete Setup (Recommended)

If you want to set up your own virtual environment:

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/h1mzy0ti/Expense-Tracker-API.git
   cd expense_tracker_api
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run migrations**

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser (optional)**

   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Start the server**

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access**

   * Swagger UI: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/)

### Option 2: Using Provided venv (Ultra-Minimal Setup)

If you want *immediate* local running using the pushed `venv`:

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Activate the provided virtual environment**

   ```
   source venv/bin/activate       # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
   ```

3. **Run the server directly**

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

> *Note:* Since SQLite is used, no DB setup is needed, and you can run immediately after activating venv.

---

## Notes

* SQLite ensures the project requires minimal setup and runs locally out of the box.
* All expense routes are protected and require JWT authentication.
* Usage instructions and dependencies are included for easy local testing.
